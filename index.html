      <h4>Guide to CAM and CNC</h4>
      <a href="https://nikkijhart.github.io/documents/cnc_guide.pdf">Project Documentation</a>
      <p>To ensure machining knowledge lost over the pandemic was preserved for future years, I wrote 
        a guide to Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM) and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) mills for my project team,
      <a href="https://cuauv.org">CUAUV</a>. The information in this guide is compiled from Cornell's
      CNC class (MAE 5250), online resources, and other Cornell project teams.</p>

      <h4>Aurora Frame</h4>
      <a href="https://nikkijhart.github.io/documents/Aurora_Spring_2021_Documentation">Project Documentation</a>
      <p>During my sophomore year, I was tasked with designing the frame of <a href="https://cuauv.org">CUAUV</a>'s newest vehicle, Aurora. 
        I designed the vehicle layout to meet requirements and objectives for the 34 external enclosures and components, then designed
        38 unique mechanical parts to secure those components to the vehicle, focusing on modularity and ease of maintenance.
