      <p>I completed my final rotation as an undergraduate NASA Pathways Intern on ER4's Dexterous Robotics team. In the summer of 2023, I led the software
      development for one of our team's major deliverables, a demonstration of a robotic manipulator wiping a 
        href="https://www.uab.edu/engineering/eitd/projects/cold-stowage/merlin">MERLIN freezer</a> seal. I wrote ROS 2 action servers,
  clients, and messages for perception, motion planning, and a graphical user interface (GUI) and successfully demonstrated the full task sequence at the end of the summer.

      <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/software-robotics-and-simulation-division/robotic-systems-technology-branch/">Robotic Systems Technology Branch</a>
      <p>I completed my first and second rotations as a Pathways Intern at NASA's Johnson Space Center in the spring and fall of 2022. During my internship in
        CI5, my most impactful project was writing a parser and translator in Python that would automatically generate Mission Control displays for Artemis II and
        beyond. In ER4, I completed my first software engineering and robotics internship. My primary tasking was learning ROS (1) and ROS 2; then, using that knowledge,
        I used a <a href="https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge">ROS 1/ROS 2 bridge</a> to create a single simulation of a mobile base and robotic manipulator.

      <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/">Apple iPad</a>
      <p>During the summer of 2022, I worked on Apple's Touch Sensing Hardware team on multiple projects related to electronics packaging. These projects included test fixture design,
        the development of test procedures, test equipment selection, analysis of FEA data, and electromechanical device modeling.

      <p>During the summer of 2021, I worked under the mentorship of a Packaging Engineer in <a href="https://www.moog.com/markets/aircraft.html">Moog's Aircraft Group</a>. 
        I contributed to the development of the Battery Management Unit (BMU) and the Battery Module (BM), two avionics boxes for fully-electric commercial aircraft. I completed four
        projects: the design and drafting of a test fixture for a printed wiring board (PWB), the design and drafting
        of a vibration fixture for the BMU, designing solutions to an assembly alignment issue, and creating a thermal simulation of the BM.
