      Awards: JSC Co-op Award (Center-level)
      <p>During my final rotation as an undergraduate Pathways Intern, I led the software development for one of our team's major deliverables, a demonstration of a robotic manipulator wiping a 
        <a href="https://www.uab.edu/engineering/eitd/projects/cold-stowage/merlin">MERLIN freezer</a> seal. I designed and implemented a pipeline for perception, user input, and motion planning, 
        then successfully demonstrated the full task sequence on hardware at the end of the summer.

      <h4>NASA (ER4 Robotic Systems Technology Branch)</h4>
      Awards: Shining Star Intern Award (Agency-level), JSC Co-op Award (Center-level)
      <p>I completed my first robotics software engineering internship in the fall of 2022. I contributed to a trade study 
        for the design of a mobile manipulator, then bridged ROS1 and ROS2 software stacks to create a single simulation of 
        the mobile manipulator. The dual-arm mobile manipulator is now a part of NASAâ€™s

      <h4>Apple (iPad Touch Sensing Hardware Team)</h4>
      <p>During the summer of 2022, I worked on Apple's Touch Sensing Hardware team on multiple projects related to electronics packaging. These projects included test fixture design,
        the development of test procedures, test equipment selection, analysis of FEA data, and electromechanical device modeling.

      <p>During my first rotation as a Pathways Intern, I used Python to automate the generation of 55 Mission Control displays for Artemis II 
        and more for future missions. I also completed an ISS data analysis project, a system dependency documentation project, and much of 
        the training for becoming a certified Flight Controller.

      <h4>Moog (Aircraft Group)</h4>
      <p>During the summer of 2021, I worked on avionics packaging for fully-electric commercial aircraft. I completed four projects: 
        the design and drafting of a test fixture for a printed wiring board (PWB), the design and drafting of a vibration fixture 
        for an avionics box, the design of two solutions to an assembly alignment issue, and the simulation of heat dissipation for 
        another avionics box.
